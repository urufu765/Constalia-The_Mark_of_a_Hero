# Constalia-The_Mark_of_a_Hero
Just a game I'm developing for fun


Constalia is the series, The Mark of a Hero is the game's name.
There's going to be a lot of beginner mistakes and errors as I'm not that experienced at coding. This project is meant for me to just have fun and learn along the way.
There's no clear storyline I want to persue, or any main quest. Perhaps something might happen down the line.


Also keep in mind the releases may get flagged as malware, but this is just a false positive, the file is perfectly safe. If you can't run the executable, get the zip instead. The catch is you'll need Python version 3 to run it, which you can quickly obtain at python's official website.

## Update a.1.1 (check out the Changalog for full details):
  Anything duplicated is now gone *(most legacy, some recent)*, new folders, and replaced audio with different sounds (and smaller files). Changed some code to accomodate for new textures stuff. Oh and also one new texture: the wall.

**Current Version:** *a.1.1.1*
