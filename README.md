# Constalia-The_Mark_of_a_Hero
Just a game I'm developing for fun


Constalia is the series, The Mark of a Hero is the game's name
There's going to be a lot of beginner mistakes and errors as I'm not that experienced at coding. This project is meant for me to just have fun and learn along the way.
There's no clear storyline I want to persue, or any main quest. Perhaps something might happen down the line.
